    "You've been tasked with designing an experiment to test whether a new email template will be more effective for your company's marketing team. The current template has a 5% response rate, which has outperformed numerous other templates in the past. As a result of some very poor performance from some of these alternative templates, the company is both excited to test this new design that was developed internally, and nervous about losing sales, if it is not to work out. As a result, they are looking to determine how many individuals they will need to serve the new email template to in order to detect a 1% performance increase (or drop)."
